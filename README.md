# Formula 1 - FrontEnd Project 🏁🏎️
Redesign of the Formula 1 website. Made to practice some FrontEnd technologies that I am learning. The original UI design was taken from Akram Khalid on Dribbble.

❌ The site is not responsive yet. To see it correctly, see it on desktop
💬 This is a practice project, later I want to make a second version with many more features
